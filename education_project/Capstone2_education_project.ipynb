    "## Business Context\n",
    "Research shows that high-poverty areas disproportionally educate children of color. The chances of ending up in a high-poverty or high-minority school are highly determined by a student’s race/ethnicity and social class. For instance, African American and Hispanic students—even if they are not poor—are much more likely than white or Asian students to be in high-poverty schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a growing body of evidence that shows increased investment on education returns better outcomes and that the positive effects are even greater among low-income students. On the other hand, it costs more to educate low-income students and provide them with a robust education capable of overcoming their initial disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. Understand the current demographics of wealthy to high-poverty schools across the state of California.\n",
    "2. Identify how much funding is available per pupil in wealthy vs high-poverty areas.\n",
    "3. Learn what factors are most correlated with student performance.\n",
